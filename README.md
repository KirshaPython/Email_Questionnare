# Email_Questionnare
This project contains a simple web page with a survey form that allows users to share their experiences with various medications. The completed forms are submitted using Web3Forms and sent to a specified email address.

How to Set Up Your Own Survey
To use this form and receive submissions to your own email, follow these steps:

Get an Access Key:

Go to Web3Forms.
Sign up and generate a new access key.
Replace the Access Key in the Code:

<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="70337c2e-b25f-4bb3-97f6-62a282a1c600">

Replace the existing access key with your newly generated one.

You can test it locally by opening the questionnare.py file in your browser.
